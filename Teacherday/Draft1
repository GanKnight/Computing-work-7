#Cool story
This, is a story.
Nothing much special, no beasts no giants.
But
Interesting.
The first day,
I was alone, but spirits in the sky,
I stepped into Dunman High.
I anticipated the great fun we would experience, and that breath of fresh air.

Then came the teachers.
Ms Ng seemed like a very cheerful teacher, with a smile on her face she welcomed us all.
Mdm Sim felt like a stern teacher, I was kind of worried of provoking her.
When she approached me, I was like 
***Oh. You're approaching me?***
But in a nervous way.
Obviously I was mistaken, she was the opposite of strict.
Haha
The end
