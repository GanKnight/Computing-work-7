# First Day Of School</br>
This, is a story.</br>
Nothing much special, no beasts no giants.</br>
But</br>
Interesting.</br>
The first day,</br>
I was alone, but knew that I would not be soon,</br>
As I stepped into Dunman High.</br>
I anticipated the great fun we would experience, and that breath of fresh air.</br>

Then came the teachers.</br>
Ms Ng seemed like a very cheerful teacher, with a smile on her face she welcomed us all.</br>
Mdm Sim felt like a stern teacher, I was quite worried of provoking her.</br>
As she approached me, I thought, </br>
***Oh. You're approaching me?***</br>
But in a nervous way of course.</br>
Obviously, I was beyond wrong. She was the opposite of strict!</br>
Haha</br>
The end</br>
